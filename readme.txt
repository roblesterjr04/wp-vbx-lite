Wordpress VBX - Powered by Twilio. Provides an internet based phone system managed right from your wordpress site.

== Description ==

Wordpress VBX with Twilio(c) lets you create a professional phone system for your users or subscribers to connect with. 

Admins are able to manage phone numbers, and create call flows for voice and messaging that will dial numbers by user, group, or specific number. The admin can set greetings, and program user based voicemail as well.

The plugin is extendable for developers as well! Developers can create plugins that interact with WP VBX core functions and also build applets to be used in vbx flows.

**NOTE: You need a Twilio Account for this plugin to work. Charges will apply.**
